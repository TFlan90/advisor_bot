# Career Advisor Chatbot Project

This project is a career advising chatbot created using AIML. The chatbot, named **"Advisor Bot,"** is designed to interact with students, helping them identify potential career paths in the Information Technology field based on their academic strengths and interests.

## Features

- **Personalized Greeting:** The chatbot starts by asking for the user's name to create a more personal interaction.
- **Guided Career Discovery:** It guides students through a simple decision tree, starting with their strongest subject in the computer science curriculum.
- **Interactive Dialogue:** Utilizes user responses to narrow down interests within a broader subject area.
- **Job Recommendations:** Recommends one of ten distinct computing jobs based on the user's input, including but not limited to:
  - Robotics Software Engineer
  - Embedded Systems Engineer
  - Network Engineer
  - Security Engineer
  - Technical Project Manager
- **External Resources:** Provides a clickable link for each recommendation, allowing students to explore the career path further.
- **Flexible Input:** Uses AIML's pattern matching capabilities to understand variations in user input, creating a more natural conversational flow.
